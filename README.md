# Name quiz block

Test your memory for names with this “who’s that face” quiz game block. The game only gets harder as you keep choosing
correctly. Perfect for reviewing names in an Employee Directory table (or even competing against your fellow coworkers)!

## How to remix this block

1. Create a new base (or you can use an existing base).

2. Create a new block in your base (see [Create a new block](https://airtable.com/developers/blocks/guides/hello-world-tutorial#create-a-new-block),
   selecting "Remix from Github" as your template.

3. From the root of your new block, run `block run`.
